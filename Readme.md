# Readme 

This project is an lightweight version of the [Codebase Digest](https://github.com/kamilstanuch/codebase-digest). 

This Python app takes your codebase and generates a single-file dump with:
- code structure
- code itself
- basic summary of the codebase

The output then can be pasted directly into LLMs, like ChatGPT, Google Gemini and others so you can use your prompts on it.

If you want some inspiration about possible prompts, visit the [Codebase Digest](https://github.com/kamilstanuch/codebase-digest) repository and its [LLM Prompts section](https://github.com/kamilstanuch/codebase-digest?tab=readme-ov-file#llm-prompts-for-enhanced-analysis).
